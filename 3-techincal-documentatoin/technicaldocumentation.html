        <header>Introduction to Python Programming</header>
        <p>Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike due to its diverse applications, from web development to data science.</p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
        </div>
        <p>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. This flexibility allows developers to choose the style that best suits their project needs.</p>
        <p>
          Python's extensive standard library offers modules and functions to perform various tasks, reducing the need for writing code from scratch. This feature is particularly beneficial for rapid application development.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Understanding_Data_Structures_in_Python">
        <header>Understanding Data Structures in Python</header>
        <p>Data structures are essential for organizing and managing data efficiently in Python. The most common data structures include lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.</p>
        <p>Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different data types. They are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after creation.</p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] </code>
        </div>
        <p>Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be altered once created. This immutability makes tuples useful for fixed data collections.</p>
        <p>Dictionaries in Python store data in key-value pairs, providing fast access to elements based on their keys. This feature makes them ideal for tasks involving data lookups.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Object-Oriented_Programming_in_Python">
        <header>Object-Oriented Programming in Python</header>
        <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent data and methods. Python's OOP features include classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</p>
        <p>Classes in Python define the blueprint for creating objects. They contain attributes (data) and methods (functions) that define the behavior of the objects.</p>
        <div class="code">
          <pre><code># Example of a Python class
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Working_with_Files_in_Python">
        <header>Working with Files in Python</header>
        <p>File handling is a crucial aspect of programming, allowing data to be stored and retrieved from external files. Python provides built-in functions to work with files, such as opening, reading, writing, and closing files.</p>
        <p>Files can be opened in different modes, including read ('r'), write ('w'), and append ('a'). The 'with' statement in Python is used to handle file operations, ensuring proper resource management.</p>
        <div class="code">
          <pre><code># Example of file handling in Python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!")
</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>Reading from a file can be done using the read(), readline(), or readlines() methods, depending on the desired output format. Writing to a file involves the write() or writelines() methods.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Web_Development_with_Python">
        <header>Web Development with Python</header>
        <p>Python is a powerful tool for web development, offering frameworks like Django and Flask. These frameworks provide the necessary tools to create dynamic and scalable web applications.</p>
        <div class="code">
          <pre><code># Example of a simple Flask application
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Welcome to Flask!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
</code></pre>
        </div>
